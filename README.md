Homework 01
First thing I did was, used diffrent tags such as, "article", "section" etc. to make the code easier to read.
Second I inputted id= before "search engine optimization" so when I clicked it, it would be directed to that part.
Third I added "display: flex" to the header class so the menu bar would follow as you scroll.
